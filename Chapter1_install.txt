Installing on Ubuntu
On Ubuntu, the QGIS project provides packages for the LTR, LR, and DEV versions. For this book we recommend installing the LTR version.
To avoid conflicts that may occur due to incompatible packages, make sure that you only add one of the following package-source options. The specific lines that you have to add to the source list depend on your Ubuntu version. The below version is latest release for Debian stretch:
deb     https://qgis.org/debian stretch main
deb-src https://qgis.org/debian stretch main
After choosing the repository, we will add the qgis.org repository's public key to our apt keyring. This will avoid the warnings that you might otherwise get when installing from a non-default repository. Run the following command in the terminal:
wget -O - https://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2017.gpg.key | gpg --import
gpg --fingerprint CAEB3DC3BDF7FB45
gpg --export --armor CAEB3DC3BDF7FB45 | sudo apt-key add -
If necessary, you might need to make adjustments based on your system. For an updated list of supported Ubuntu versions, check out http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu.                                                                           By the time this book goes to print, the key information might have changed. Refer to http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu for the latest updates.
Finally, to install QGIS, run the following commands. The first will fetch any updates to packages on your system, the second will install qgis, the python library and the grass plugins.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass
